Constraint Propagation
When trying to solve a problem, you'll find that there are some local constraints to each square. These constraints help you narrow the possibilities for the answer, which can be very helpful. We will learn to extract the maximum information out of these constraints in order to get closer to our solution. Additionally, you'll see how we can repeatedly apply simple constraints to iteratively narrow the search space of possible solutions. Constraint propagation can be used to solve a variety of problems such as calendar scheduling, and cryptographic puzzles.
