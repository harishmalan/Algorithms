Search
In the process of problem solving, we may get to the point where two or more possibilities are available. What do we do? What if we branch out and consider both of them? Maybe one of them will lead us to a position in which three or more possibilities are available. Then, we can branch out again. At the end, we can create a whole tree of possibilities and find ways to traverse the tree until we find our solution. This is an example of how search can be used.
